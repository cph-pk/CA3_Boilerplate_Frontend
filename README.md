## Steps for setup
1. Open bash in the root of the project.
2. Type: `npm install` to get the npm packages.
3. Type: `npm run build` to build the project.
4. Type: `npm start` to see the how the project runs local.
5. (Optional) You can deploy your project either on your      virtual machine or thru surge.
      I've chosen surge since it will reduce the trafic to my virtual machine for this assignment. 
      Start by installing surge with the following command in bash `npm install --global surge`. 
      Now you can deploy your project on surge with the command `surge --project ./build --domain A_DOMAIN_NAME.surge.sh`.
